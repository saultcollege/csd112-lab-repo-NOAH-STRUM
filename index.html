        <h1>Welcome to Noah Strum's Website!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Noah Strum, and I was born and raised in Sault Ste. Marie
          Ontario. I’m currently going to school for Computer Programming at
          Sault College. The reason I chose Computer Programming was because I
          am very interested in it. My high school Computer Programming teacher
          also said I should take this program because I have talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy playing video games and camping. My favorite
          video game right now is Ark: Survival Evolved and Call of Duty
          Warzone. I have a dog named Leo; he is a German Shepherd Doberman mix.
          I have also been working part time for the last two years at subway.
